## 📅 Week 1 & 2 Progress

### ✅ 1st Assignment: Kaggle Python Course

* I completed the **[Kaggle Python Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)**, which covered essential Python concepts like variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and data handling.
* This laid the foundation for ML by strengthening my core Python skills.

### ✅ 2nd Assignment: Python Libraries

* Worked on an assignment given by our mentors covering:

  * 🐼 **Pandas**
  * 🧮 **NumPy**
  * 📈 **Matplotlib**
  * 🐍 Python basics (lists, dictionaries, loops, etc.)
